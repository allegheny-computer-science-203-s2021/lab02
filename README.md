## Summary 

Designed for use with [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/), this
repository contains the starter for Laboratory 2 in Computer Science 203. As
part of this assignment, you should answer all of the questions in the
`reflection.md` file, furnishing evidence of your contributions to this week's
effort towards completing the long-term software engineering project. Students
who have questions about this task should talk with a student technical leader
or the course instructor. Before the due date for this laboratory assignment,
please ensure that:

- You are able to build, test, and use the current version of GatorMiner. 

- You understand the purpose and functionality of GatorMiner.

- You have a clear understanding of how to use ZenHub board.

- You made significant contributions in your team, as evidenced by creation of new issues
and appropriate modifications made to existing issues in the project repository.

- You explored the Python programs and packages used by the long-term software engineering project.
  
- This GitHub repository contains a completed reflection file.

## Objectives

* To practice organizing teams and team roles in preparation for the long-term software engineer project.

* To experience project onboarding. 

* To learn how to use ZenHub boards to manage a software project.

* To continue to learn how to use GitHub and the GitHub Flow model to support collaboration among a team of software engineers.

* To continue to learn how to use Markdown to complete technical writing tasks.

* To reflect on the process to be able to continue improving professional and technical skills.

## Following the Code of Conduct

Throughout the completion of this software engineering project you must adhere
to the code of conduct that we developed as part of a previous laboratory
assignment. In addition to reporting any violations of the code of conduct,
please make sure that you attest to the fact that you followed the code of
conduct. Students who think that the software engineering team should revise
some aspect of the code of conduct must use the GitHub issue tracker for that
repository to suggest, discuss, and implement any required changes. 

## Documenting Your Mastery of Technical and Professional Skills

Even though this long-term software engineering project involves a multiple-week
effort, you are expected to make significant contributions to the project every
week. As a means for documenting your contributions to this project, you should
fully complete the reflection document and, additionally, annotate the
assessment guide to track your proficiency of the professional and technical skills
in the field of software engineering. For every category for which you decide an
assessment is appropriate, you should write a couple of sentences reporting
your current level of proficiency and the evidence that you would furnish to support
your assessment. If there is not a description next to one of the assessment
criteria, then the instructor will assume that you are currently working at the
:disappointed: level. Please note that you are responsible for documenting your
proficiency of all the technical and professional skills in software engineering by
the completion of this long-term software project.

## Assignment Assessment

The grade that a student receives on this assignment will have the following
components.

- **GitHub Actions CI Build Status [up  to 30%]:**: For each of three repositories associated with this assignment students will receive a checkmark grade if their last before-the-deadline build passes. Students are encouraged to repeatedly revise their submission to ensure that all relevant repositories receive a CI pass.

- **Mastery of Technical Writing [up  to 15%]:**: Students will also receive a checkmark grade
  when the responses to the technical writing questions presented in the
  `reflection.md` reveal a mastery of both writing skills and technical
  knowledge. To receive a checkmark grade, the submitted writing should have
  correct spelling, grammar, and punctuation in addition to following the rules
  of Markdown and providing technically accurate answers. Students are
  encouraged to ask the course instructor or a student technical leader to use
  the GitHub issue tracker to provide feedback on their mastery of technical
  writing skills.

- **Level of Contribution [up  to 30%]:**: Students will also receive a checkmark grade
  when their level of contribution indicates active engagement in the process of planning for
  contributions to the software engineering project. The engagement should be reported 

- **Mastery of Technical Knowledge and Skills [up  to 25%]**: Students will also receive a
  checkmark grade when their GitHub repository reveals that they have mastered
  all of the technical knowledge and skills developed during the completion of
  this assignment. As a part of this grade, the instructor will assess aspects
  of the project including, but not limited to, the use of effective Markdown
  syntax, correct use of GitHub flow practices, and appropriate Git commit messages.
  Students are encouraged to ask the course instructor or a student technical leader
  to use the GitHub issue tracker to provide feedback on how well their work demonstrates
  mastery of the assignment's technical knowledge and skills.

All grades for this project will be reported through a student's gradebook GitHub
repository.


## Reporting Problems

If you have any problems with the completion of this assignment, then please
create an issue in this repository using the "Issues" link at the top of this
site. Before this assignment is submitted by the due date, all the issues in
this repository should have been assigned to a team member, discussed, handled,
marked as resolved, and then closed.
